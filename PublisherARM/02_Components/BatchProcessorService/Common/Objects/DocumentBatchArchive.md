## Classes, properties and methods (developer reference)

### `DocumentBatchArchive : DocumentBatch` - Archive Batch Processor

**Purpose:** Handles bulk archiving of documents to Azure Storage with regulatory compliance support and progress tracking.

#### Constructors

##### Default Constructor

* `public DocumentBatchArchive() : base()` — Creates new archive batch instance

**Initialization:**

```csharp
this.batchType = BatchType.Archive;
```

**Use Case:** Creating new archive batches programmatically.

##### Database Constructor

* `public DocumentBatchArchive(int batchID) : base(batchID)` — Loads existing archive batch from database

**Loading Process:**

1. **Base Loading:** Calls `base(batchID)` to load core batch properties
2. **Archive-Specific Query:** Calls `sp_SELECT_BATCH_ARCHIVE` for archive details
3. **Property Mapping:** Loads `isFinal` flag from archive-specific table
4. **Type Override:** Explicitly sets `batchType = BatchType.Archive`

**Two-Phase Loading Pattern:**

* Phase 1: Base constructor loads general batch metadata via `sp_SELECT_BATCH`
* Phase 2: Derived constructor loads archive-specific data via `sp_SELECT_BATCH_ARCHIVE`

**Database Schema Implication:** Archive batches have data in both base BATCH table and specialized BATCH_ARCHIVE table.

## Core Processing Methods

### Batch Creation

* `public bool createBatch()` — Processes all documents in batch for archiving

**Processing Flow:**

**1. Culture Code Capture:**

```csharp
string originalThreadCultureCode = HandyFunctions.getCurrentCultureCode();
```

**Note:** Variable captured but never used - likely vestigial code from refactoring.

**2. Progress Calculation:**

```csharp
float percentIncrementPerDocument = 100f / this.documents.Count;
float percentComplete = 0f;
```

Divides 100% evenly across all documents for linear progress tracking.

**3. Document Validation:**

```csharp
if (this.documents.Count > 0)
```

Returns `false` if no documents to process.

**4. Sequential Document Processing:**

```csharp
foreach (Document document in this.documents)
{
    this.updateProgress(percentComplete, App_GlobalResources.SiteCopy.ProcessingDocument + ": " + document.documentCode);
    document.archiveDocument(this.batchCreatedByUserKey, this.isFinal, CompositionDocument.Quality.High);
    percentComplete += percentIncrementPerDocument;
}
```

**Processing Characteristics:**

* **Sequential Processing:** Documents processed one at a time (no parallelization)
* **Progress Updates:** Before each document with document code in message
* **High Quality:** Always uses `CompositionDocument.Quality.High` for archives
* **User Context:** Passes batch creator's user key for audit trail

**5. Completion:**

```csharp
this.updateProgress(100f, App_GlobalResources.SiteCopy.Complete);
return true;
```

**Returns:** `true` if documents processed, `false` if no documents in batch.

## Persistence Methods

### Archive Batch Saving

* `public override int saveBatch()` — Saves batch with archive-specific metadata

**Two-Phase Save:**

**Phase 1 - Base Batch Save:**

```csharp
int batchId = base.saveBatch();
```

Calls parent method to save:

* Batch metadata (name, schedule, type flags)
* Batch-document relationships via SqlBulkCopy

**Phase 2 - Archive-Specific Save:**

```csharp
using (DatabaseConnector databaseConnector = new DatabaseConnector(Constants.connectionString))
{
    DatabaseParameter[] databaseParameters = new DatabaseParameter[2];
    databaseParameters[0] = new DatabaseParameter("@batchID", SqlDbType.Int, 4, batchId);
    databaseParameters[1] = new DatabaseParameter("@markAsFinal", SqlDbType.Bit, 1, this.isFinal, false);
    
    databaseConnector.Execute("sp_SAVE_BATCH_ARCHIVE", databaseParameters);
}
```

**Archive Table Storage:** Stores archive-specific properties in separate table:

* Batch ID (foreign key to BATCH table)
* Mark as Final flag (regulatory designation)

**Returns:** Batch ID from base save operation.

## Property Accessors

### Archive-Specific Properties

#### Final Archive Designation

* `public bool isFinal { get; set; }` — Indicates if archive should be marked as "final" for regulatory compliance

**Business Significance:**

* **Final Archives:** Permanent regulatory compliance records, cannot be modified
* **Non-Final Archives:** Working archives, may be superseded by later versions

**Integration with Document.archiveDocument():**
The `isFinal` flag is passed through to each document's archive operation, affecting database records and potentially triggering additional compliance workflows.

---

## Business logic and integration patterns

### Archive Processing Workflow

The class implements a sequential archive processing pattern:

## Step 1: Batch Initialization

* Batch loaded from database with archive-specific properties
* Document collection lazy-loaded from batch-document relationships

## Step 2: Sequential Processing

* Documents processed one-by-one (no parallelization)
* Each document archived to Azure Storage via `Document.archiveDocument()`
* Progress updated before each document for real-time feedback

## Step 3: Completion

* Final progress update to 100%
* Batch marked as complete via inherited `indicateBatchProcessingEnd()`

### Regulatory Compliance Support

The `isFinal` flag enables regulatory compliance workflows:

**Final Archives:**

* Immutable regulatory records
* Likely subject to retention policies
* May trigger compliance notifications
* Serve as "version of record" for legal/regulatory purposes

**Non-Final Archives:**

* Working versions or backups
* Can be superseded by later archives
* Support iterative document development

### Quality Enforcement

Archives always use high-quality PDF generation:

```csharp
document.archiveDocument(this.batchCreatedByUserKey, this.isFinal, CompositionDocument.Quality.High);
```

**Rationale:**

* Archives are permanent records requiring highest quality
* Lower quality acceptable for previews/drafts, not archives
* Ensures archived documents are suitable for printing and regulatory submission

### Integration with Program.cs

Called by batch processing service:

```csharp
// From Program.cs
private static bool processBatchArchive(DocumentBatch batch)
{
    try
    {
        DocumentBatchArchive batchArchive = new DocumentBatchArchive(batch.batchID);
        batchArchive.indicateBatchProcessingStart();

        if (batchArchive.createBatch())
        {
            batchArchive.indicateBatchProcessingEnd();
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        Log.error("WorkerRole.processBatchArchive()", exception, "Batch ID: " + batch.batchID);
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Technical implementation considerations

### Sequential Processing Design

Documents processed sequentially rather than in parallel:

**Advantages:**

* Simpler progress tracking (linear increments)
* Predictable resource usage
* Easier error handling and recovery
* No concurrency concerns

**Disadvantages:**

* Slower processing for large batches
* Underutilizes multi-core systems
* Single document failure blocks subsequent documents

**Performance Characteristics:**

* Time complexity: O(n) where n is document count
* Dominated by BlueID Composition Engine latency per document
* Azure Storage upload latency per document

### Memory Management

Efficient memory usage through lazy loading:

* Documents loaded on-demand via inherited `documents` property
* Each document processed and archived individually
* No accumulation of large data structures

### Error Handling Strategy

Inherits error handling from base class and Program.cs:

* Method returns boolean success indicator
* Exceptions caught at Program.cs level
* Progress updates wrapped in try-catch (inherited from base)
* Individual document failures logged but don't provide rollback

**Potential Issue:** If document 5 of 10 fails, first 4 are already archived with no automatic rollback mechanism.

## Integration with broader Publisher system

### Document Class Integration

Tight coupling with Document.archiveDocument():

* Passes user context for audit trail
* Enforces final designation for compliance
* Specifies high quality for regulatory requirements

### Azure Storage Integration

Indirect integration via Document class:

* Each document archived to `Constants.DocumentArchiveContainerName`
* Files named as `{archiveID}.pdf` in Azure Blob Storage
* Metadata stored in database with Azure Storage reference

### Database Schema Integration

Two-table storage pattern:

* **BATCH table:** Core batch metadata (shared with all batch types)
* **BATCH_ARCHIVE table:** Archive-specific properties (isFinal flag)

**Relational Model:**

```note
BATCH (1) ─── (1) BATCH_ARCHIVE
  │
  └── (1:M) BATCH_DOCUMENT ─── (M:1) DOCUMENT
```

### Progress Tracking Integration

Real-time progress for user monitoring:

* Progress updated in database before each document
* UI can poll or subscribe to progress updates
* Message includes current document code for transparency

## Critical considerations

### Sequential Processing Bottleneck

The sequential processing approach limits throughput:

* Large batches (100+ documents) could take hours
* No utilization of parallel processing capabilities
* Single point of failure (one document failure blocks progress)

**Recommendation:** Consider parallel processing with appropriate concurrency limits to balance throughput and resource usage.

### Unused Culture Code Variable

The captured but unused culture code suggests incomplete refactoring:

```csharp
string originalThreadCultureCode = HandyFunctions.getCurrentCultureCode();
```

**Implications:**

* May indicate removed culture-switching logic
* Could suggest planned but unimplemented feature
* No impact on functionality but clutters code

**Recommendation:** Remove unused variable or document its intended purpose.

### No Rollback Mechanism

Partial batch failures leave system in inconsistent state:

* If document 5 of 10 fails, documents 1-4 are already archived
* No automatic rollback or cleanup
* Requires manual intervention to identify and resolve partial completion

**Recommendation:** Implement transaction-like behavior or checkpoint mechanism to support recovery from partial failures.

### Quality Hard-Coded

High quality always enforced for archives:

```csharp
document.archiveDocument(..., CompositionDocument.Quality.High);
```

**Considerations:**

* Appropriate for regulatory archives
* May be overkill for working archives
* No configuration option for different archive types
* Increases processing time and storage costs

**Recommendation:** Consider making quality configurable based on `isFinal` flag or other criteria.
