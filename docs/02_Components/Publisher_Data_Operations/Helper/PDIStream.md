## Classes, properties and methods (developer reference)

### `PDIStream` - Stream Management Wrapper (IDisposable)

**Purpose:** Provides unified stream and file metadata management with automatic positioning, resource cleanup, and flexible construction patterns.

#### Core Properties

##### Stream Management

* `Stream SourceStream { get; set; }` — Primary stream property with automatic positioning logic
  * **Getter Behavior:** Automatically resets stream position to 0 if seekable
  * **Setter Behavior:** Copies input stream to internal MemoryStream, handles positioning
  * **Lazy Initialization:** Creates MemoryStream if internal stream is null
  * **Position Safety:** Ensures streams are always positioned at beginning

##### Metadata Integration

* `PDIFile PdiFile { get; set; }` — Associated file metadata and processing context
* `bool IsValidStream` — Validation property checking for non-null stream with content

##### Resource Management

* `Stream _sourceStream` — Internal stream storage
* `bool disposedValue` — Standard dispose pattern tracking

#### Constructor Patterns

##### File Path Constructor

* `PDIStream(string filePath, PDIFile pdiFileName = null)`
  * **File Validation:** Checks File.Exists before processing
  * **Stream Creation:** Creates FileStream with read access and share permissions
  * **PDIFile Handling:** Uses provided PDIFile or creates new one from filePath
  * **Resource Safety:** Uses using statement for FileStream lifecycle

##### Stream + PDIFile Constructor

* `PDIStream(PDIFile pdiFileName, Stream stream)`
  * **Direct Assignment:** Assigns stream and PDIFile directly
  * **Simple Construction:** Most direct construction pattern
  * **Stream Ownership:** Takes ownership of provided stream

##### PDIFile-Only Constructor

* `PDIStream(PDIFile pdiFileName)`
  * **Path Extraction:** Uses PDIFile.FullPath for file access
  * **File Validation:** Checks file existence before stream creation
  * **Integrated Construction:** Single object provides both stream and metadata

##### Stream + Filename Constructor

* `PDIStream(Stream stream, string fileName, object con = null)`
  * **Stream Assignment:** Takes ownership of provided stream
  * **PDIFile Creation:** Creates PDIFile from filename with optional database connection
  * **Load-Only Mode:** Uses loadOnly=true when no connection provided

## Stream Property Implementation Details

### Getter Logic

```csharp
get
{
    if (_sourceStream != null && _sourceStream.CanSeek && _sourceStream.Position != 0)
        _sourceStream.Position = 0;
    return _sourceStream;
}
```

**Behavior Analysis:**

* **Position Reset:** Automatically positions seekable streams to beginning
* **Null Safety:** Returns null if no internal stream exists
* **Read Consistency:** Ensures consumers always start from stream beginning

### Setter Logic

```csharp
set
{
    if (_sourceStream is null)
        _sourceStream = new MemoryStream();
    
    if (value is null)
        return;
        
    if (value.CanSeek && value.Position != 0)
        value.Position = 0;
        
    value.CopyTo(_sourceStream);
}
```

**Behavior Analysis:**

* **Lazy Initialization:** Creates MemoryStream if internal stream doesn't exist
* **Null Handling:** Gracefully handles null input without error
* **Position Safety:** Resets input stream position before copying
* **Copy Semantics:** Always copies input stream to internal storage

---

## Resource Management and Lifecycle

### IDisposable Implementation

* `void Dispose()` — Public dispose method following standard pattern
* `protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)` — Core disposal logic
  * **Stream Disposal:** Properly disposes internal stream
  * **Reference Cleanup:** Nulls PDIFile reference
  * **Dispose Pattern:** Follows Microsoft recommended dispose pattern

### Resource Ownership

The PDIStream takes ownership of streams in different ways:

* **File Path Construction:** Creates and owns FileStream (disposed in using block)
* **Stream Assignment:** Takes ownership of assigned streams
* **Copy Semantics:** Setter creates owned copies rather than references

---

## StreamExtensions Class

### `ToBase64String` Extension Method

* `static string ToBase64String(this Stream stream)` — Stream to Base64 conversion
  * **Position Safety:** Resets stream position before reading
  * **Buffered Reading:** Uses 16KB buffer for efficient large stream processing
  * **Memory Management:** Uses MemoryStream for intermediate storage
  * **Complete Reading:** Reads entire stream content for conversion

**Implementation Details:**

* **Buffer Size:** 16KB buffer balances memory usage and performance
* **Stream Preservation:** Doesn't modify original stream (resets position only)
* **Memory Efficiency:** Streams data through buffer rather than loading entirely
* **Binary Safe:** Handles any binary stream content safely

---

## Construction Pattern Analysis

### File-Based Construction

Two patterns support file-based initialization:

1. **Explicit Path:** `PDIStream(string filePath, PDIFile pdiFileName = null)`
2. **PDIFile Path:** `PDIStream(PDIFile pdiFileName)`

Both patterns use `FileShare.ReadWrite` to allow concurrent access during processing.

### Stream-Based Construction

Two patterns for stream initialization:

1. **With PDIFile:** `PDIStream(PDIFile pdiFileName, Stream stream)`
2. **With Filename:** `PDIStream(Stream stream, string fileName, object con = null)`

Stream-based construction enables processing of in-memory data or network streams.

### Hybrid Construction

The setter on SourceStream enables runtime stream assignment regardless of initial construction method.

## Business logic and integration patterns

### Pipeline Integration Role

PDIStream serves as a data carrier throughout the processing pipeline:

* **Input Stage:** Combines file data with parsing metadata
* **Processing Stage:** Provides both stream content and business context
* **Output Stage:** Enables email attachments and data transfer
* **Error Handling:** Maintains context for error reporting and troubleshooting

### Email System Integration

Critical integration with email notification systems:

* **PDIMail Integration:** Used as attachment source for SMTP email
* **PDISendGrid Integration:** Provides streams for Base64 attachment encoding
* **Attachment Context:** PDIFile provides filename and validation context

### Stream Positioning Consistency

Automatic stream positioning ensures consistent behavior:

* **Consumer Safety:** All consumers receive streams positioned at beginning
* **Multiple Access:** Stream can be accessed multiple times safely
* **Processing Reliability:** Eliminates stream position-related errors

### Memory Management Strategy

The copy-on-assignment pattern in the setter:

* **Advantages:** Ensures stream ownership and independence
* **Disadvantages:** Potentially doubles memory usage for large streams
* **Trade-offs:** Reliability vs. memory efficiency

---

## Technical implementation considerations

### Performance Characteristics

* **Memory Usage:** Copy semantics can double memory footprint
* **Stream Operations:** Automatic positioning adds overhead but ensures consistency
* **Large Files:** 16KB buffering in ToBase64String optimizes large file handling
* **Resource Cleanup:** Proper disposal prevents memory leaks

### Thread Safety

Current implementation is not thread-safe:

* **Stream Access:** Multiple threads could interfere with position setting
* **Property Access:** No synchronization around SourceStream property
* **Dispose Safety:** Dispose pattern not thread-safe

### Stream Type Compatibility

Works with various stream types:

* **FileStream:** Primary use case for file-based processing
* **MemoryStream:** Internal storage and in-memory processing
* **Network Streams:** Can handle non-seekable streams (with limitations)
* **Compressed Streams:** Compatible with ZIP archive entry streams

### Error Handling

Limited error handling in current implementation:

* **File Existence:** Checks File.Exists in file-based constructors
* **Null Streams:** Graceful null handling in setter
* **Stream Exceptions:** No specific handling for stream operation failures
